            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Although this website started small, it has sprouted into an invaluable resource of 
                community information. We are proud to showcase the following awards.</h2><br>

                        <h4>issued by The Maritime Web Site Awards</h4>

                        <p>"As far as we know, this is quite a unique and fascinating website that will be of interest
                             not only to offshore divers, but to historians and indeed anyone interested in the ships 
                             that now lie peacefully on the seabed around the shores of Ireland.</p>
                             
                        <p>A simple, excellent interactive map hides the huge amount of work that has gone into 
                            researching and listing the many hundreds of wrecks that lie around that unforgiving 
                            and stormy coastline.</p>
                             
                        <p>The website goes much further, with very useful descriptions of vessel types (as they 
                            originally were !) to be found down there. No flashy web design, but a site like this
                            doesn't need it - the content alone will keep you glued for hours ! "</p>
