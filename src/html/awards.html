				<h2>Gold Site Award</h2>
				<h4>issued by The Maritime Web Site Awards.</h4>
				<p>"As far as we know, this is quite a unique and fascinating website that will be of interest
					not only to offshore divers, but to historians and indeed anyone interested in the ships 
				   that now lie peacefully on the seabed around the shores of Ireland.
				   
					   A simple, excellent interactive map hides the huge amount of work that has gone into researching
					and listing the many hundreds of wrecks that lie around that unforgiving and stormy coastline.
				   
				   The website goes much further, with very useful descriptions of vessel types (as they originally were !) 
				   to be found down there. No flashy web design, but a site like this doesn't need it - the content alone 
				   will keep you glued for hours ! "</p>

				<h2>World Class Website Award</h2>
				<h4>issued by HindSight Fishing Charters' World Class Website Awards Program</h4>
				<p>"After carefully reviewing your site, we would like to honor you with HindSight Fishing Charters'
					World Class Website Award for surpassing our criteria of excellence in concept, design, layout, 
				   rich content and easy navigation. We acknowledge the effort you have put into your website; the time, 
				   hours and countless obstacles. Display your award with pride! "</p>

				<h2>Nautical Awards Program</h2>
				<h4>issued by the Lagoon View Yacht Club</h4>

					honor Irish Wrecks On-line with our Award of Merit. Congratulations."</p>
